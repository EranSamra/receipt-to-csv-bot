# ‚úÖ **Multiple Items Per Invoice Enhancement Complete!**

## üéØ **Enhancement Summary**

Successfully updated the Receipt Data Extractor to handle multiple items under the same invoice number correctly.

### üìä **Key Improvement**

**Before**: Each item might get a different invoice number or only one row per receipt
**After**: Multiple items from the same receipt/invoice all share the SAME invoice number

## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **Enhanced Extraction Prompt**
```javascript
Invoice Number: Receipt number, invoice ID, transaction reference, or order number. 
If multiple items appear on the same receipt/invoice, use the SAME invoice number 
for ALL items from that receipt. If multiple rows have the same invoice number, 
use the same invoice number for all related rows. Leave blank if not found.
```

### **Updated Extraction Rules**
```javascript
One row per distinct receipt or transaction. If a file contains multiple receipts, 
output one row per receipt. If a single receipt contains multiple items, create 
one row per item but use the SAME invoice number for all items from that receipt.
```

### **Added Clear Example**
```javascript
Example for multiple items on same receipt:
If a receipt shows:
- Invoice #12345, Coffee $5.00, Sandwich $8.50, Total $13.50

Output should be:
Invoice Number,Date,Amount,Currency,Merchant,Transaction Type
12345,2024-01-15,5.00,USD,Coffee Shop,Card
12345,2024-01-15,8.50,USD,Coffee Shop,Card
```
