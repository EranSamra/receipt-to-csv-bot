# 🚀 **Batch Processing for 30 Receipts Implemented!**

## ✅ **Features Added**

### 📊 **Batch Processing**
- **Batch Size**: 5 files processed simultaneously
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delay between batches
- **Memory Management**: Processes files in chunks to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Individual file errors don't stop the entire batch

### 📈 **Scalability**
- **File Limit**: Up to 30 receipts per upload
- **File Size**: 5MB limit per file
- **Parallel Processing**: 5 files processed concurrently within each batch
- **Progress Tracking**: Batch-by-batch progress logging

### 🔄 **Processing Flow**
1. **Upload**: Up to 30 files accepted
2. **Batching**: Files divided into groups of 5
3. **Parallel Processing**: Each batch processes 5 files simultaneously
4. **Rate Limiting**: 2-second pause between batches
5. **Result Aggregation**: All results combined into single CSV

## 📊 **Batch Processing Logic**

```javascript
// Configuration
const BATCH_SIZE = 5; // Process 5 files at a time
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 2000; // 2 second delay

// Processing Flow
for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
  const batch = files.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
  
  // Process batch in parallel
  const batchPromises = batch.map(async (file) => {
    // Individual file processing
  });
  
  // Wait for batch completion
  const batchResults = await Promise.all(batchPromises);
  
  // Add delay between batches
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES));
}
```
