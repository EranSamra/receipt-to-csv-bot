```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 5; // Process 5 files at a time
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 1000; // 1 second delay
```

- Detailed logging for each batch and file
- Graceful handling of API rate limits

#### **Memory Management**
- Files processed in batches to prevent memory overflow
- Base64 encoding optimized for large volumes
- Automatic cleanup after each batch
